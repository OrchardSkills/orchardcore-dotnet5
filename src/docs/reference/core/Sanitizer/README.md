# HTML Sanitizer

An HTML Sanitizer is available as part of the Orchard Core Infrastructure.

The Sanitizer cleans user input that could lead to XSS attacks.

It is used by default for the following parts and fields:

- HTML Body Part
- HTML Field
- Markdown Body Part
- Markdown Field

!!! note
    To disable sanitization on these fields disable the `Sanitize Html` option in the field or part settings.

## Razor Helper

`@Orchard.SanitizeHtml((string)Model.ContentItem.HtmlBodyPart.Html);`

## Configuring the Sanitizer

The sanitizer is configurable using `IOptions<HtmlSanitizerOptions>` during service registration with a configuration 
extension method `ConfigureHtmlSanitizer`.

By default it allows css classes, but can be configured to accept other attributes.

You may call this extension method multiple times during the startup pipeline to alter configurations.

```
services
    .AddOrchardCms()
    .ConfigureServices(tenantServices =>
        tenantServices.ConfigureHtmlSanitizer((sanitizer) =>
            {
                sanitizer.AllowedSchemes.Add("mailto");
            }));
```
